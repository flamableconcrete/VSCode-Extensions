# flamableconcrete's VS Code Extension List

Here are most of the VS Code extensions I use and my quick thoughts on them.

## Top 5 Favorites

My current favorites.

* [autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) - Quickly generate python docstrings for functions. Even more helpful if you use Python typing. I prefer the Numpy style guide with this.
* [Continue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) - Open Source AI assistant that you can connect to your own local or hosted LLMs. [Official website](https://www.continue.dev/).
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Lots of stuff, but I use it just to see who edited each line last easily while editing code in a git repo.
* [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - Rainbow colored indentation! Makes it easier to see where code lines up in long functions. And its just pretty!
* [Ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff) - Python autoformatter. Replaces [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) for me.
