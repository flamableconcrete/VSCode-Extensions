# flamableconcrete's VS Code Extension List

Here are most of the VS Code extensions I use and my quick thoughts on them.

## Top 5 Favorites

My current favorites.

* [autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring) - Quickly generate python docstrings for functions. Even more helpful if you use Python typing. I prefer the Numpy style guide with this.
* [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter) - Best python autoformatter out there IMO.
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Lots of stuff, but I use it just to see who edited each line last easily while editing code in a git repo.
* [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - Rainbow colored indentation! Makes it easier to see where code lines up in long functions. And its just pretty!
* [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) - SSH into a remote machine to develop there instead.

* [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) - See real time output of JavaScript in the IDE as you develop. Seems like magic.
* [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) - Organizes all your Todos from your code into a nice view. My problem is I never go back to TODOs anyway.
